gmx40-prep-scripts
==================

A collection of hacked-together useful scripts to mitigate the pain of
preparing systems with Gromacs 4.0.*.

This will not solve all your problems, but may help by giving you a
starting point when trouble shooting GMX 4.0 system preparation.

Take a look at the 'prepare-gmx40.sh' script for an example workflow.


Dependencies
============

In order to run you need the 'pdb2gmx' (from gromacs) and 'tleap' (from ambertools) in your PATH.
